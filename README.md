# Gas-Leakage-Detector1
📘 Short Project Description

This project is a Gas Leakage Detection System built using an ESP32 microcontroller and an MQ-5 gas sensor. The MQ-5 sensor continuously checks the presence of LPG or methane gas in the air. When the gas level becomes high, the sensor’s digital output changes and the ESP32 detects the leakage. The system then turns ON an LED alarm and prints a warning message on the Serial Monitor. This project provides a low-cost and effective solution for early gas leak detection in homes and kitchens.
